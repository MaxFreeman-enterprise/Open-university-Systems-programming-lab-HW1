# Open-university-Systems-programming-lab-HW1
in this assignment we have two programs the first one by the name of my_scalar we were asked to write in the C language a program that receives two vectors and calculates their Dot product and prints the result, the rest of the description will be in the readme file.


In the second question we were asked to write a program called find_bits receives as input two variables x, y of the unsigned long type. If:

A value represented by bits 11111001 was entered into variable x
And the variable y was entered a value represented by bits 11000011
The program must print that the number of lit bits is 3
